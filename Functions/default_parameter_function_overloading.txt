Default parameters and function overloading
==============================================

Functions with default parameters may be overloaded. For example, 
the following is allowed:
    
    void Print(char *strString);
    void Print(char ch=' ');

If there user were to call Print(), it would resolve to Print(' '), 
which would print a space.

However, it is important to note that default parameters do NOT count 
towards the parameters that make the function unique. Consequently, 
the following is not allowed:
    
    void PrintValues(int nValue);
    void PrintValues(int nValue1, int nValue2=20);

If the caller were to call PrintValues(10), the compiler would not be 
able to disambiguate whether the user wanted PrintValues(int) or 
PrintValues(int, 20) with the default value.
