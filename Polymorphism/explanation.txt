What is polymorphism?
=======================

In programming languages, polymorphism means that some code or 
operations or objects behave differently in different contexts.

For example, the + (plus) operator in C++:

    4 + 5       <-- integer addition
    3.14 + 2.0  <-- floating point addition
    s1 + "bar"  <-- string concatenation!

In C++, that type of polymorphism is called overloading.

Typically, when the term polymorphism is used with C++, however, 
it refers to using virtual methods,
